GeoAlchemy 2 Documentation
==========================

*Using SQLAlchemy with Spatial Databases.*

GeoAlchemy 2 provides extensions to `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ for
working with spatial databases.

GeoAlchemy 2 focuses on `PostGIS <http://postgis.net/>`_. PostGIS 2 and PostGIS 3 are supported.

GeoAlchemy 2 also supports the following dialects:

* `SpatiaLite <https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/libspatialite/home>`_ >= 4.3.0 (except for alembic
  helpers that require SpatiaLite >= 5)
* `MySQL <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/spatial-types.html>`_ >= 8
* `GeoPackage <http://www.geopackage.org/spec/>`_

Note that using GeoAlchemy 2 with these dialects may require some specific configuration on the
application side.

GeoAlchemy 2 aims to be simpler than its predecessor, `GeoAlchemy
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoAlchemy>`_. Simpler to use, and simpler
to maintain.

   changelog

The current version of this documentation applies to the version |version| of GeoAlchemy 2. See the
:ref:`changelog` page for details on recent changes.


Requirements
------------

GeoAlchemy 2 requires `SQLAlchemy <http://sqlalchemy.org>`_ >= 1.4.

Installation
------------

GeoAlchemy 2 is `available on the Python Package Index
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/GeoAlchemy2/>`_. So it can be installed
with the standard `pip <http://www.pip-installer.org>`_ or
`easy_install <http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_
tools.

What's New in GeoAlchemy 2
--------------------------

* GeoAlchemy 2 supports PostGIS' ``geometry`` type, as well as the ``geography``
  and ``raster`` types.
* The first series had its own namespace for spatial functions. With GeoAlchemy
  2, spatial functions are called like any other SQLAlchemy function, using
  ``func``, which is SQLAlchemy's `standard way
  <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/expression_api.html#sqlalchemy.sql.expression.func>`_
  of calling SQL functions.
* GeoAlchemy 2 works with SQLAlchemy's ORM, as well as with SQLAlchemy's *SQL
  Expression Language* (a.k.a the SQLAlchemy Core). (This is thanks to
  SQLAlchemy's new `type-level comparator system
  <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/types.html?highlight=comparator_factory#types-operators>`_.)
* GeoAlchemy 2 supports `reflection
  <http://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/core/schema.html#metadata-reflection>`_
  of geometry and geography columns.
* GeoAlchemy 2 adds ``to_shape``, ``from_shape`` functions for a better
  integration with `Shapely <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely>`_.
