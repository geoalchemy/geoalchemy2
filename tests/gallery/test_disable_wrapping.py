"""
Disable wrapping in select
==========================

If the application wants to build queries with GeoAlchemy 2 and gets them as strings,
the wrapping of geometry columns with a `ST_AsEWKB()` function might be annoying. In
this case it is possible to disable this wrapping.
This example uses SQLAlchemy ORM queries.
